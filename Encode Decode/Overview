🔐 Caesar Cipher Encryption/Decryption 🔐

A simple Python program to encode or decode messages using the Caesar Cipher technique, a type of substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet.

Features:
🔑 Encrypt or Decrypt messages
🔄 Customizable shift value for encoding/decoding
🌟 Simple user interface for input

Explanation of Mechanism:
1.The program uses the Caesar Cipher technique to shift each letter by the given number.
2.The alphabet is defined, and the shift is applied to each letter.
3.It handles both encryption and decryption based on the user's choice.
4.The program wraps around the alphabet (from z back to a and vice versa) for shift values that go beyond z or below a.
