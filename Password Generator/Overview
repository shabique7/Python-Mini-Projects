🔐 Password Generator
A simple Python script to generate strong, random passwords based on user-specified criteria.
Great for beginners learning Python fundamentals like loops, lists, and the random module.

💡 Features
Choose the number of letters, symbols, and numbers in your password.

Generates:
>An easy password (characters in order)
>A hard password (characters fully shuffled for more security)

🛠 How It Works:
1.Takes user input for how many letters, symbols, and numbers they want.
2.Randomly selects characters from predefined lists.
3.Assembles an “easy” password with ordered characters.
4.Shuffles characters to generate a more secure “hard” password.
